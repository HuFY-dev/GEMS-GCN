This project explores the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for link prediction in graphs. The GCN model is implemented using the Deep Graph Library (DGL) in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- DGL
- NumPy

## Usage

The main code for the GCN model is implemented in `link_predict.py`. To train and test the model on ogbl-colab, run the following command:
```
python link_predict.py
```
The trained model will be saved in the root directory, and the evaluation results will be printed to the console.

## Dataset

The ogbl-colab dataset from Open Graph Benchmark [1] is used in this project. It consists of a heterogeneous graph with 3 types of nodes (papers, authors, and institutions) and 4 types of edges (author-paper, paper-author, paper-institution, and institution-paper).

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the GCN implementation in the DGL documentation [2]. The ogbl-colab dataset is from the Open Graph Benchmark [1]. Special thanks to ChatGPT for providing guidance and support throughout the project.
